Day 3! A lot of good work was done today in a bunch of different areas.

## Pages 
I made a quick username page for when the tracker is opened, so that appropriate completions can be shown based on the player.

I finished full area and tower tables as well, with the following features:
- Difficulty
- Length Indicators (jtoh.info) doesn't have this
- Extra info on hovering
- Average area difficulties
- Table sorting from easiest to hardest

## Optimizations
The badge checking algorithm was heavily optimized, and I was able to get around the ratelimiting issue from yesterday by rotating IP addresses, making the badge system *much* faster!

## Plans
The whole project is coming together now and I think most of the challenges have already been overcome. I hope to release this soon!
