We're now 1 week into development! Over the past two days, I made some solid progress on the project.  

## Filters
I finished the filters for **uncompleted towers**, and also added **styling** for both completed and uncompleted towers. Hopefully this looks better compared to what we had before.

Here's a screenshot of the new filter styling:

## Difficulty Tables
I added tables for every difficulty level, so players can now see which towers belong to each difficulty when viewing their stats:

## Donations
I also started working on a database system for **donations**, which will let me offer advanced features and give recognition to supporters directly on the site. A leaderboard page is currently being made for this!
