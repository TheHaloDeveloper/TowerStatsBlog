## Uncompleted Towers
I woke up and added a new table that shows a player's **uncompleted towers**. This makes it super easy to see what’s left to beat, rather than just focusing on what’s already been done.

Here’s a quick demo of the new table and how it works:  

!asset uncompleted.mp4  

## Plans
Tomorrow, I’ll work on:
- Adding tables for difficulty  
- Filters for uncompleted towers  
- Optimizing the process of fetching tower info to make everything faster  

I'm getting excited to release this!!
