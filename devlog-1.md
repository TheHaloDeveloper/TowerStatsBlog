After seeing lot's of complaints in the community about [jtoh.info](https://jtoh.info/) not working anymore, I decided to build a better solution for the community myself. My goal is to improve the core idea in all aspects that I can, so [jtoh.info](https://jtoh.info/) becomes irrelevant üòÅ. Let's see where this goes!

## Data Collection
I spent most of the day today writing a scraper script to get area and tower info from the [JToH Wiki](https://jtoh.fandom.com/). The creator of the old website had to update tower info manually when something changed, which made update times very slow. This new script enables much faster updates on tower info, so things can remain up-to-date.

At the end of the day, the scraper was finished:

## Plans
Tommorow I hope to work on checking badge data to view a player's completed towers. Thank you to everyone who provided feedback today!
