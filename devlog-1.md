## Completions
Today I started by creating the tower completions table! It's currently very long and tends to flow over the page, so I'll need to add a scrollbar to it later. Since mini towers don't give tower points, they show up as "-" for the tower number. This lets you guys track mini towers and other misc. completions without interfering with the main game!

## Filters
I also wanted to add filters to display "jumps" (new hardest towers), tower types (such as steeple, tower, citadel), and more. I started with jumps, and got it working:

After more work, I was able to successfully get many more filters ready and working:
- World Selection
- Tower Type
- Tower Difficulty
